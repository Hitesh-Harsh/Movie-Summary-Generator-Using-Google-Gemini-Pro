I developed a YouTube Video Summarizer using Google Gemini Pro and the YouTube Transcript API to generate concise summaries of YouTube videos. The tool extracts transcripts, processes them with advanced language models, and produces brief yet comprehensive summaries. This allows users to quickly grasp key points and insights without watching the entire video, enhancing efficient information consumption and time management.
